## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset to understand the factors affecting children's anemia. The goal is to extract insights from the data and build a machine learning model to predict key outcomes.

## Data Preprocessing

Preprocessing steps ensure that the dataset is clean and ready for analysis:

- **Handling Missing Values:** Missing data was imputed or removed based on the analysis requirements.
- **Data Type Conversions:** Categorical variables were encoded for model readiness.
- **Normalization/Scaling:** Numerical features were normalized or scaled to prepare for machine learning algorithms.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA helps to understand the distributions and relationships within the data:

### Univariate Analysis

- **Age Distribution:** A histogram visualizes the distribution of age.
- **Hemoglobin Levels:** Box plots highlight potential outliers and spread.
- **Place of Residence:** Bar plots show the distribution of residence (rural vs. urban).

### Bivariate Analysis

- **Scatter Plots:** Relationships between age and hemoglobin levels.
- **Correlation Heatmaps:** Visualize correlations between numerical variables.

## Feature Engineering

Several new features were created to enhance the dataset:

- **AgeCategory:** Converting age groups into numerical midpoints.
- **HemoglobinDifference:** Difference between hemoglobin levels adjusted for altitude and smoking.
- **BirthsInterval:** Interval between the respondentâ€™s age and the age at first birth.
- **WealthEducationInteraction:** Interaction term between wealth index and education level.
- **SmokingAnemia:** Binary feature indicating whether the individual smokes and has moderate anemia.

## Model Building

The insights from EDA and feature engineering informed the model-building process:

- **Outlier Handling:** Decisions regarding whether to retain or remove outliers.
- **Feature Selection:** Evaluation of newly created features to determine their importance.
- **Model Training:** Training machine learning models with the processed dataset.

## Results

The performance of the machine learning models is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additional visualizations like ROC curves and confusion matrices may be included.
